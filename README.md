简单描述一下概率论的小知识

two different interpretations of probability:  

frequentidt interpretation: long run frequency of event.

扔了很多次硬币得出50%的正反面结论。

bayesian interpretation of probability： quantify of uncertainly about something.

相信下一次扔硬币有各一半扔到正面和反面的机会。   

advantage: 可以用到没有大量实验的地方, based on how probable we think this event is.

p(A): denotes the probability that the event A is true.

A=1 the event is true, A=0 the event is false.

P(): called probability mass function 概率质量函数

probability of a union of two elements: p(A or B)

joint probabilities: p(A,B)

marginal distribution 边际分布

conditional probability 条件概率
